# My Rollup Starter

I only use Rollup for micro libraries to be consumed by a node and or babel project.

Typically I'd use Webpack for large projects.

## Features

* AVA test suite
* build generates
	* `jsnext:main` = es build
	* `main` = umd build

### TODO

* Coverage?

## Commands

* `npm test`
* `npm run build`

## Notes

The `src/hello-world` example is written in a weird way just so it
tests the basic features I want supported by default.
